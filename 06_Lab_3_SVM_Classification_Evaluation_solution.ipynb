The 5 neighbours solution is a more 'complex model' (why?) and the mean class accuracy seems to be better. The choice of model will depend on your goals. If you don't care about predicting `IE` correctly, the `1000` neighbour model gives greater overall accuracy and is a simpler model.  therefore I would err towards using it. However, your application may tolerate a drop in overall accuracy in return for better 'mean class accuracy' - in this case, you may consider the more complex 5 neighbour model."
